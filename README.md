# Factorial Native

Implementation of a trivial Factorization algorithm for Android using **Native Interface**.


The application makes use of the [*gamma*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function) function provided by C. This allows the computation of non-integers such as doubles, provided they are positive.
